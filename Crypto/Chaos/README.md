[DECRYPTED]: Perhaps the flag is encoded in Base64? Or maybe hex?
[DECRYPTED]: Or maybe the real flag is just one character different from all these fakes?
[FLAG FOUND]: VishwaCTF{Fl4g_Or_N0t_Th4t_1s_Th3_QuesT10n}
[DECRYPTED]: Maybe the flag is hidden elsewhere...
[FLAG FOUND]: VishwaCTF{T00_M4ny_F4k3_Fl4Gs_G00d_Luck}
[DECRYPTED]: Or inside a comment in the source code?
[DECRYPTED]: This is not the flag, keep looking!
[DECRYPTED]: Or maybe there's a script generating multiple fake flags dynamically?
[FLAG FOUND]: VishwaCTF{CrYpt0_cRyPT0_1g_It_1s_sOm3_7hiNg_t0_D0}
[DECRYPTED]: Maybe it's inside another challenge, cross-referencing flags?
[DECRYPTED]: Or is it?
[DECRYPTED]: But wait... isn't this too obvious?
[DECRYPTED]: What if it's a hash of the real flag?
[FLAG FOUND]: VishwaCTF{NoT_ThE_ReaL_fLaG_K33P_tRy1Ng}
[DECRYPTED]: Or hidden in an image using steganography?
[DECRYPTED]: Happy hunting!
[FLAG FOUND]: VishwaCTF{Y0u_WiLl_N3v3r_F1nd_1t}
[DECRYPTED]: Or maybe the real flag is hidden inside a hidden file?
[DECRYPTED]: Find_the_real_flag_somewhere_in_this_mess
[DECRYPTED]: Oh, did you think that was real? Keep digging!

this is the real flag
